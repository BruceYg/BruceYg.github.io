## About Me
I am a first-year PhD student in Engineering at the University of Cambridge, supervised by [Prof. Bill Byrne](https://sites.google.com/view/bill-byrne/home). I am fully funded by the Cambridge International Scholarship from Cambridge Trust.

My research interests include Multilingual Models, Neural Machine Translation, LLM Alignment, Minimum Bayes Risk Decoding, and Diffusion Models.
